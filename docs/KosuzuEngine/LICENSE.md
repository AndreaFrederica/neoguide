3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Code Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or suppress any patent notices in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must be distributed under the terms of this
    License, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how
    they can obtain a copy of this License; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
    or sell it, or license it to third parties as long as You comply with
    Section 3.1, and You must do all of the following:

    (i) make all reasonable efforts to provide the Source Code Form of the
        Covered Software, and inform recipients how they can obtain a
        copy of this License; and

        terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this
        License; and

        for at least three (3) years from the date of distribution, and
        inform recipients of their rights under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with other material not governed by the terms of this License,
then the requirements of this License apply only to the Covered Software
parts.

3.4. Notices

You must duplicate all notices contained in this License in any
distribution of the Covered Software. You must also duplicate this
License in any distribution of the Covered Software. If You distribute
the Covered Software in Executable Form, you must duplicate any notices
contained in Exhibit B in any distribution of the Covered Software
in Executable Form.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty
or additional liability.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License
----------------------------

This License applies to all Covered Software. You may not use the
Covered Software except in compliance with this License. You must include
a copy of this License with every copy of the Covered Software You
distribute.

6. Versions of the License
---------------------------

6.1. New Versions

The Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in
Section 6.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify or publish new versions of this License.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

6.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name "Mozilla" or "MPL" from the name of your modified
license (except that you may continue to use the name "Mozilla" or "MPL"
to describe that your license is based on this License).
